// Babel is a very famous transpiler that basically allows us to use future JavaScript in todayâ€™s browsers. 

// In simple words, it can convert the latest version of JavaScript code into the one that the browser understands.



//Why do we need Babel? 

// The main reason we need Babel is that it gives us the privilege to make use of the 
// latest things JavaScript has to offer without worrying about whether 
// it will work in the browser or not

// Note: It is also good to note that a compiler is totally different from a transpiler as 

// the transpiler converts source code into another source code at the same abstraction level, 

// whereas the compiler converts code into a lower-level code generally.

//  Like in Java, the source code is converted to byte Code which is lower level and not equivalent.
