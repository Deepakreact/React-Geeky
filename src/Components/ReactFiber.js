// React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm and the core algorithm that drives the rendering process in React.

// The primary goal of React Fiber is to improve the performance and rendering capabilities of React

// Incremental Rendering: React Fiber introduces the concept of time-slicing,
//  which allows the rendering work to be split into small units called "fibers." 
//  These fibers can be worked on incrementally, allowing React to prioritize and interrupt rendering work to respond to user interactions, 
//  animations,
//  or other high-priority tasks. This helps improve the responsiveness and perceived performance of React applications.

// Better Support for Asynchronous Rendering: React Fiber provides better support for asynchronous rendering patterns. 
// It enables the use of Suspense and lazy components to handle code splitting and dynamically loading components as needed. With Fiber,
//  it becomes easier to build components that
//  can suspend rendering and show fallback content while waiting for data or other resources to load.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Error Handling and Error Boundaries: React Fiber improves error handling by introducing the concept of error boundaries.
//  Error boundaries are special components that catch and handle errors that occur during rendering,
//   preventing the entire component tree from being unmounted. With error boundaries, 
// you can gracefully handle errors and display fallback UI without affecting the rest of the application.

// Render Prioritization and Scheduling: React Fiber allows the developer to control and prioritize the rendering work. 
// It introduces a concept called "work in progress" where React can schedule and prioritize different parts of
//  the component tree to be rendered or updated based on their priority or importance.
//  This helps optimize the rendering process and ensure that high-priority updates are processed quickly.
